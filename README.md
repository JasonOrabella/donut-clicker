[Donut Maker Requirements](https://wecancodeit-materials.netlify.app)

This donut maker meets all concerns I believe. It costs 100 for an auto clicker, I have a line of code that can be commented in an out to make the auto-clicker scale with the multiplier, currently it only adds 1 per second. It adds at the same time it iterrates, it may be good to seperate those concerns in the future, as it would make it appear more smooth.
